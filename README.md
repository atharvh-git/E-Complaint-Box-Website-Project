# E-Complaint Box Website Project
E-Complaint Box Website project using HTML, CSS and JS i.e. JavaScript languages.
This was my group project in third year of my B.Tech under the subject 'E-skill Workshop'.
E-Complaint Box webpage is basically a form which collects the data regarding the complaint filled by the complainee about any issue he/she is facing in the college campus. This form takes some basic personal information of the complainee such as name, mobile number, email address, the class and stream in which he/she is studying. All this data is sent to a particular mail ID which is specified there in the code.
